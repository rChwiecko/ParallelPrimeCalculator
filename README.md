# Parallel Prime Number Calculator

A high-performance multithreaded application written in C that calculates prime numbers within a specified range. This program demonstrates data parallelism by splitting the workload across multiple threads, each tasked with finding and summing prime numbers within a unique sub-range.

## üìú Overview
This project utilizes pthreads to implement a multithreaded approach for prime number calculation. By distributing the workload, it maximizes efficiency, especially for large ranges, showcasing the power of parallel computation in C.

## üöÄ Features
- **Multithreading**: Distributes the workload among multiple threads for faster computation.
- **Dynamic Range Allocation**: Each thread is assigned a specific range of numbers, avoiding overlap and improving performance.
- **Prime Summation and Counting**: Each thread calculates both the sum and count of primes in its range, with results combined for a grand total.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler (or any C compiler that supports pthreads)
- Git for cloning the repository

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rChwiecko/ParallelPrimeCalculator
   
   cd ParallelPrimeCalculator
   ```

2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o calculator calculator.c 
   ```

### Usage
Run the program with the following command:
```natural
./calculator <num_1> <num_2>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./calculator 25 100
```

### Output Example
```
Thread # 1 is finding primes from low = 4 to high = 8
Thread # 0 is finding primes from low = 0 to high = 4
Thread # 4 is finding primes from low = 16 to high = 20
...
Thread #23 Sum is 0, Count is 0
Thread #24 Sum is 97, Count is 1
Thread #22 Sum is 89, Count is 1

        GRAND SUM IS 1060, COUNT IS 25
```
